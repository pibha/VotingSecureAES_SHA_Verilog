# VotingSecureAES_SHA_Verilog
Elections is one such area where authentication and security is concerned. The AES and SHA algorithms can be used together to securely store and verify passwords in a voting machine. Each voter is assigned a unique password that is hashed using SHA-256 and encrypted using AES with a secret key. The encrypted password is stored in a secure database. When a voter approaches the voting machine, they are prompted to enter their password. The entered password is hashed using SHA-256 and encrypted using AES with the same secret key. The encrypted entered password is compared to the stored encrypted password. If they match, the voter is authorized to use the voting machine and cast their vote. This algorithm ensures that only authorized voters can use the voting machine, and their passwords are securely stored and verified.
